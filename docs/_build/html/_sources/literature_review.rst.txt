:cite:`malkiel1987`  (p. 1) defines market efficient formally:

    'the market is said to be efficient with respect to some information set, :math:`\Phi`, if security prices would be
    unaffected by revealing that information to all participants. Moreover, efficiency with respect to an information
    set, :math:`\Phi`, implies that it is impossible to make economic profits by trading on the basis of :math:`\Phi`'

The three classical categories for the information set, as posed by :cite:`fama1970` are: weak form, where :math:`\Phi` is
past prices; semi-strong form, where :math:`\Phi` is all publicly available information (including past prices); strong
form, where :math:`\Phi` is all information, including private (and all publicly available information).

One can ask if hypothetical trading based on a specific :math:`\Phi` would earn economic profits as a test for market
efficiency related to :math:`\Phi`. Nevertheless, this requires a specific model that 'specifies the nature of market
equilibrium when prices 'fully reflect' available information' :cite:`fama1970` (p. 414).

As :cite:`fama1991` (p. 1575), referring to :cite:`fama1970`, states 'market efficiency per se is not testable'.
Anomalous evidence can refer to efficiency or the asset pricing modeling, the split being ambiguous in accordance
with :cite:`roll1977`.

In this approach, one must first choose :math:`\Phi`, then specify a model of 'normal' returns, and finally compute
the abnormal returns as the difference between the return on a security and its normal return, using
:math:`\Phi` (:cite:`TEoFMi`). 'If the abnormal security return in unforecastable, [...] then the hypothesis
of market efficiency is not rejected' :cite:`TEoFMi` (p. 22).

:cite:`fama1970` concludes weak-form tests are strongly in support of the market efficiency hypothesis,
and semi-strong form tests also support the hypothesis. Two decades later, :cite:`fama1991` concludes controversy
about market efficiency lies mostly on return predictability tests.

In the case of efficiency related to political events, :cite:`li2006` find markets react to political
uncertainty related to elections. Similar findings are reported in :cite:`goodell2013` and :cite:`smales2015`.
:cite:`mcmenamin2016` concludes markets under-react to elections. :cite:`marquessantos` analyses the impact of political
events on the main stock market index in Brazil and concludes only major events impact the index.
