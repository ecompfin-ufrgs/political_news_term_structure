To do:

* Read section 12.2 'Fitting Term-Structure Models to the Data' from :cite:`TEoFMi`.

  * It's been a while I don't read about econometrics, the last time was when reading the references given at the
    meeting of :ref:`meeting-30-09-21`, when I was not very successful in understanding all the concepts. Thus, it will
    probably be considerably hard to understand the subsection on its own. I will probably have to read not only the
    given subsection, but earlier chapters as well. It is possible I'll have to read also :cite:`FIM2012`, and also not
    only the section on the Vasicek model, but the preceding content as well. Also, if this references are not enough,
    another bibliographic research might be needed in order for me to gain a sufficient understanding of model and its
    estimation.

Done:

* Read subsection 12.2 from :cite:`TEoFMi`.

  * Not of much use.

* Read section 7.2 from :cite:`FIM2012`.

  * Noticed the specific estimation we will make is a panel data estimation. This explains why it was previously so
    difficult to find papers on the Vasicek estimation, as in the absence of any panel data reference in the search for
    papers, most of the literature found was about time series estimation.
  * Found some references that might be useful: :cite:`gib1993`, :cite:`daves1993` and :cite:`chan1992`.
