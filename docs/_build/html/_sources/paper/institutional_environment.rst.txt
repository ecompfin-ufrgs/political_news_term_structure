Institutional Environment
=========================



Our constitution describes Brazil as a Federative Republic, which constitutes a Democratic Rule of Law, where
'all power emanates from the people, who exercise it through elected representatives or directly'
:cite:`constituicao` (Art. 1). According to the Constitution the three, independent branches of government,
are the Legislative, the Executive and the Judiciary :cite:`constituicao` (Art. 2).

The Brazilian Financial System was instituted in :cite:`lei4595`. It established the National Monetary Council as
the major normative institution and the Central Bank as the major executive institution. The Monetary Council defines
- monetary and exchange - policy guidelines, which are executed by the Central Bank - that has the monopoly of currency
and executes its policies through operations with public debt securities (issued by the National Treasury).
The Commission of Transferable Securities was established in :cite:`lei6385`, and disciplines and supervises
the transferable securities market. The only securities exchange in Brazil, B3, acts in all branches of the
transferable securities market.

The so-called Economic Tripod - a definition of specific regimes for fiscal, monetary and exchange policies
- was established in 1999 in :cite:`decreto3088`. The monetary policy would follow an inflation targeting regime.
The target for the inflation rate would be defined by the Monetary Council, the target for the short-term interest
rate would be defined - every 45 days - by the Monetary Policy Committee, and the Central Bank would pursue that
interest rate.
