 abstract = {Much controversy about causality and related concepts has arisen in the philosophical literature, and the haze surrounding the discussion has spread to other fields, among them econometrics. This brief outline stresses certain general principles and ideas that are relevant for actual research activity in the natural and social sciences. The main points are: (1) The concept of causality is indispensable and fundamental to all science; (2) The controversial issues are not latent in the concept of causality itself, but in certain questionable hypotheses, so-called "laws of causality," such as the universal scope of causality, the certainty (irrevocability) of a cause-effect relationship, the connection of causality with theories of induction, the principles of determinism and freedom of the will, etc; (3) A definition of causality which seems to be adequate from both common-sense and scientific points of view is suggested with reference to the well-known situation of the controlled experiment; (4) Some general remarks on statistical methods from the viewpoint of the dual distinction between descriptive and explanatory analysis and between experimental and nonexperimental observations are made; (5-6) Some comments are offered on causal relations as a tool in econometrics, with special regard to the rationale of different types of economic models.},

 abstract = {The long history of the theory of option pricing began in 1900 when the French mathematician Louis Bachelier deduced an option pricing formula based on the assumption that stock prices follow a Brownian motion with zero drift. Since that time, numerous researchers have contributed to the theory. The present paper begins by deducing a set of restrictions on option pricing formulas from the assumption that investors prefer more to less. These restrictions are necessary conditions for a formula to be consistent with a rational pricing theory. Attention is given to the problems created when dividends are paid on the underlying common stock and when the terms of the option contract can be changed explicitly by a change in exercise price or implicitly by a shift in the investment or capital structure policy of the firm. Since the deduced restrictions are not sufficient to uniquely determine an option pricing formula, additional assumptions are introduced to examine and extend the seminal Black-Scholes theory of option pricing. Explicit formulas for pricing both call and put options as well as for warrants and the new "down-and-out" option are derived. The effects of dividends and call provisions on the warrant price are examined. The possibilities for further extension of the theory to the pricing of corporate liabilities are discussed.},

  abstract={Financial Asset Pricing Theory offers a comprehensive overview of the classic and the current research in theoretical asset pricing. Asset pricing is developed around the concept of a state-price deflator which relates the price of any asset to its future (risky) dividends and thus incorporates how to adjust for both time and risk in asset valuation. The willingness of any utility-maximizing investor to shift consumption over time defines a state-price deflator which provides a link between optimal consumption and asset prices that leads to the Consumption-based Capital Asset Pricing Model (CCAPM). A simple version of the CCAPM cannot explain various stylized asset pricing facts, but these asset pricing 'puzzles' can be resolved by a number of recent extensions involving habit formation, recursive utility, multiple consumption goods, and long-run consumption risks. Other valuation techniques and modelling approaches (such as factor models, term structure models, risk-neutral valuation, and option pricing models) are explained and related to state-price deflators. The book will serve as a textbook for an advanced course in theoretical financial economics in a PhD or a quantitative Master of Science program. It will also be a useful reference book for researchers and finance professionals. The presentation in the book balances formal mathematical modelling and economic intuition and understanding. Both discrete-time and continuous-time models are covered. The necessary concepts and techniques concerning stochastic processes are carefully explained in a separate chapter so that only limited previous exposure to dynamic finance models is required.},

  abstract={I find that the standard class of affine models produces poor forecasts of future changes in Treasury yields. Better forecasts are generated by assuming that yields follow random walks. The failure of these models is driven by one of their key features: the compensation that investors receive for facing risk is a multiple of the variance of the risk. This means that risk compensation cannot vary independently of interest rate volatility. I also describe and empirically estimate a class of models that is broader than the standard affine class. These 'essentially affine' models retain the tractability of the usual models, but allow the compensation for interest rate risk to vary independently of interest rate volatility. This additional flexibility proves useful in forming accurate forecasts of future yields.},

  abstract={The efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) is one of the most important economic and financial hypotheses that have been tested over the past century. Due to many abnormal phenomena and conflicting evidence, otherwise known as anomalies against EMH, some academics have questioned whether EMH is valid, and pointed out that the financial literature has substantial evidence of anomalies, so that many theories have been developed to explain some anomalies. To address the issue, this paper reviews the theory and literature on market efficiency and market anomalies. We give a brief review on market efficiency and clearly define the concept of market efficiency and the EMH. We discuss some efforts that challenge the EMH. We review different market anomalies and different theories of Behavioral Finance that could be used to explain such market anomalies. This review is useful to academics for developing cutting-edge treatments of financial theory that EMH, anomalies, and Behavioral Finance underlie. The review is also beneficial to investors for making choices of investment products and strategies that suit their risk preferences and behavioral traits predicted from behavioral models. Finally, when EMH, anomalies and Behavioral Finance are used to explain the impacts of investor behavior on stock price movements, it is invaluable to policy makers, when reviewing their policies, to avoid excessive fluctuations in stock markets.},

The objective of this paper is to present contradictions within the evidence about market efficiency and discuss efficiency measurement as an emerging approach. The paper presents the evolution of research and also the lack of convergence between evidence provided by the literature and the lack of consistent arguments for explaining them. The paper also presents a framework that illustrates intermediate levels of efficiency and the first approach designed to measuring market efficiency. Finally the paper points out that divergences amongst the empirical evidence found in the literature should be considered as a key issue and further efforts should focus on specific conceptual elements inherent to its operationalization. Therefore, econometric models should not be given the exclusive responsibility of explaining market efficiency, nor possibility of incorporating alternative epistemological perspectives into the efficient / inefficient duality should be kept outside.},

abstract = {This paper examines the behaviour of the stock and options markets in London during the 1987 election. We find an extremely close relationship between opinion polls and the FTSE 100 Index of share prices. However, in the last week of the election the options prices showed evidence of gross inefficiency: they implied a decreasing probability of a Conservative win while the polls indicated the opposite. The inefficiency was sufficiently large for a volatility arbitrage to be feasible, net of transactions costs. These two tests appear to indicate that a speculative bubble was present in the options.}

 abstract = {We model and examine the impact of information releases on market uncertainty as measured by the implied standard deviation (ISD) from option markets. Distinguishing between scheduled and unscheduled announcements, we hypothesize that since the timing, although not the content, of scheduled announcements is known a priori, the pre-release ISD will impound the anticipated impact of important releases on price volatility and that the ISD will normally decline post-release as this uncertainty is resolved. Conversely, we hypothesize that the unexpected high volatility caused by major unscheduled releases will cause market participants to adjust upward their estimates of likely volatility over the remaining life of the option resulting in an increase in the ISD. Our evidence supports both hypotheses. The ISDs that we consider are from the T-Bond, Eurodollar, and Deutschemark options markets. We examine scheduled macroeconomic news releases such as the employment report and the PPI. We also find that the observed tendency for the ISD to fall on Fridays and rise on Mondays is due to the weekday pattern of scheduled news releases.},

abstract = {This paper investigates a sample of 27 OECD countries to test whether national elections induce higher stock market volatility. It is found that the country-specific component of index return variance can easily double during the week around an election, which shows that investors are surprised by the election outcome. Several factors, such as a narrow margin of victory, lack of compulsory voting laws, change in the political orientation of the government, or the failure to form a government with parliamentary majority significantly contribute to the magnitude of the election shock. Furthermore, some evidence is found that markets with short trading history exhibit stronger reaction. Our findings have important implications for the optimal strategies of institutional and individual investors who have direct or indirect exposure to volatility risk.}

Then we looked for periods of abnormal volatility which might be associated with political events using a parametric and a nonparametric method. Notwithstanding there were news like important politician been arrested and even speculation about the beginning of an impeachment process, we found relation between abnormal volatilities and political news only in Ibovespa returns during Presidential Elections.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a parametrically parsimonious model for yield curves that has the ability to represent the shapes generally associated with yield curves: monotonic, humped, and S-shaped. The authors find that the model explains 96 percent of the variation in bill yields across maturities during the period 1981-83. The movement of the parameters through time reflects and confirms a change in Federal Reserve monetary policy in late 1982. The ability of the fitted curves to predict the price of the long-term Treasury bond with a correlation of 0.96 suggests that the model captures important attributes of the yield/maturity relation.

 abstract = {There occurs on some occasions a difficulty in deciding the direction of causality between two related variables and also whether or not feedback is occurring. Testable definitions of causality and feedback are proposed and illustrated by use of simple two-variable models. The important problem of apparent instantaneous causality is discussed and it is suggested that the problem often arises due to slowness in recording information or because a sufficiently wide class of possible causal variables has not been used. It can be shown that the cross spectrum between two variables can be decomposed into two parts, each relating to a single causal arm of a feedback situation. Measures of causal lag and causal strength can then be constructed. A generalisation of this result with the partial cross spectrum is suggested.},

  abstract={ We test the theory of the term structure of indexed-bond prices due to Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (CIR). The econometric method uses Hansen's generalized method of moments and exploits the probability distribution of the single-state variable in CIR's model, thus avoiding the use of aggregate consumption data. It enables us to estimate a continuous-time model based on discretely sampled data. The tests indicate that CIR's model for index bonds performs reasonably well when confronted with short-term Treasury-bill returns. The estimates indicate that term premiums are positive and that yield curves can take several shapes. However, the fitted model does poorly in explaining the serial correlation in real Treasury-bill returns.

The authors find that the most successful models in capturing the dynamics of the short-term interest rate are those that allow the volatility of interest rate changes to be highly sensitive to the level of the riskless rate. A number of well-known models perform poorly in the comparisons because of their implicit restrictions on term structure volatility. They show that these results have important implications for the use of different term structure models in valuing interest rate contingent claims and in hedging interest rate risk.
