Expected Results
================

The literature on political events and market efficiency we reviewed - :cite:`li2006`, :cite:`goodell2013`,
:cite:`smales2015`, :cite:`mcmenamin2016` and :cite:`marquessantos` - suggest major political events do affect
financial assets. Nevertheless, most research analyze elections, which have clear impact in financial assets given
they may change public policies and therefore all the economy. When all political events are analyzed
:cite:`marquessantos`, the conclusion is that only major events affect financial assets. In the case of the spot rate,
:cite:`marquessantos` actually concludes no political event caused impact.

Given the recent literature, we could expect to find a negative answer to our research question, however we are
analyzing the whole term structure, which represents much more information than the spot rate alone. Consequently,
the expected result is a positive answer for the research question.
